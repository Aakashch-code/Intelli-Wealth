## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us keep the community safe by following these steps:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**  
   This helps prevent exploitation before a fix is released.

2. **Report privately** via GitHub’s [private vulnerability reporting](../../security/advisories/new) feature.  
   Alternatively, you can email us at: **security@yourdomain.com** (replace with your contact).

3. **What to expect:**  
   - You will receive an acknowledgement within **48 hours**.  
   - We will provide regular updates (at least once a week) on the status of your report.  
   - Once the issue is resolved, we will disclose the fix publicly and credit you (if you want).  

Thank you for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities and helping improve project security!
